# README

Quick reference guide for bicycle maintenance. While resources like YouTube videos are excellent teaching guides, they are slow to consume and don't offer an easy way to search for specific steps. By offering a textual breakdown with links to related videos, this tool seeks to act as more of a novice mechanic's companion than a learner's first exposure to bike maintenance protocols.
